Note: this is a good start on how to install python and openssl, up until crytography and impacket. Payloads are still
being tested.

# bbmk2
trials

I haven't found any single source of properly configuring BBmk2 to work on current systems.
There's a lot of information but it's not newb friendly and it's dispersed widely.
So I'm documenting this for myself and anyone else who wants to try using the most recent releases
of any tools. So here it is:

Getting Bashbunny Mk2 to work properly in mid-2023. Work in progress. We will go all the way through
installing Python3, Openssl3, Impacket, and Responder. At that point installing more tools is pretty
straightforward. Next is the many trials and tweaks to get the payloads (ie, quickcreds/smbexfiltrator)
to run or execute at all.
